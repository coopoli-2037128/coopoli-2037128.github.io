                What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

                You got the limo out front. Ooh Ah ooh. How to style every shoe every color. Yeah when you're famous it can be kinda fun. It's really you but no one ever discovers. Who would of thought that a girl like me. Would double as a superstar. You get the best of both worlds. Chillin out take it slow. Then you rock out the show. You get the best of both worlds. Mix it all together and you know you got the best of both worlds.
